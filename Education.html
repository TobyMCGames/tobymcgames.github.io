					When I was in primary school, I used legos for robotics where we could build our own robot and program it. 
					There were various types of activities we could base our robots on. 
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Sumo</li>
						<li>Racing</li>
						<li>Soccer</li>
					</ul>
					I was suppose to be part of a competition but I forgot about it.<br>
					My teammate had to solo the competition after that.<br>
					I only received a call about it after the compeition when I woke up. Whoops

					Tri-touch club was a community service club where we learned about social interaction. <br>
					There were various activities we did as well as excursions <br>
					There were stuff like:
					<ul>
						<li>Playing the ukelele</li>
						<li>Sculpting and Painting</li>
						<li>Entertaining the elderlies at an Old Folk's Home</li>
					</ul>
					None of the members were good at the ukelele including me. Everyone felt awkward.<br>
					The sculptures we made were to be sold. The most popular ones were Pokemon related.<br>
					As for the elderlies, we would play the ukelele and dance with them.

					Japanese Sakura club is hosted by senior students within the school.
					The club does activities relating the Japan.
					However, since there were so many they split it up into 4 different clubs.
					<ul>
						<li>Drawing (AAA)</li>
						<li>Cosplay</li>
						<li>Dancing</li>
						<li>Origami</li>
					</ul>
					I chose AAA which teaches us how to draw characters and environments.<br>
					Apart from that they give Japanese lessons monthly given by teacher's from Japan.<br>
					I haven't been able to attend the lessons since last year because of lessons <br>
					but it's still fine :P
